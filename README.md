# U-Net-Project

Advanced Radiation Therapy Class Project 2 - Lulin Yuan

## Overview

This project implements a U-Net architecture for medical image segmentation, specifically for radiation therapy applications.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArmorBearerSlave/U-Net-Project.git
cd U-Net-Project
```

### 2. Set Up Data

**Important:** Large datasets are not included in this repository. Please follow these steps:

1. **Read the data setup guide:** See [DATA_SETUP.md](DATA_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions
2. **Create data directory:** `mkdir -p data/{train,val,test}`
3. **Add your data:** Either copy files or create symbolic links to your desktop data

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Verify Data Setup

```bash
python src/data_loader.py
```

## Working with Large Datasets

This project is designed to work with large medical imaging datasets that shouldn't be uploaded to GitHub. The repository only contains:

- Python source code
- Documentation
- Configuration files
- Small example files (if any)

Your large datasets should be stored locally in the `data/` directory, which is excluded from version control.
